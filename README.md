# DSA Practice

This repository is for my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice**.

I am using this repo to:
- Practice DSA problems regularly
- Implement solutions in **multiple programming languages**
- Strengthen my problem-solving and logic-building skills
- Keep short **notes and observations** while learning

---

## Languages Used
- **Python**
- **Java**
- **C / C++**

---

## What this repository contains
- Problem-wise folders
- Multiple approaches for the same problem (brute force, better, optimized)
- Language-wise implementations for comparison
- Notes and comments to understand *why* a solution works, not just *how*

---

## Purpose
This repository is purely for **learning and practice**.
The focus is on:
- Understanding DSA patterns
- Improving consistency
- Translating logic across different languages
- Building a strong foundation for interviews and problem solving

---

## Ongoing
I will keep updating this repository as I:
- Learn new DSA patterns
- Practice more problems
- Add solutions in more languages
- Refine my understanding through notes
